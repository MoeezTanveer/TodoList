📝 Simple Todo List Application 📆

I'm excited to share my latest project, an simple command-line Todo List application! This app goes beyond the basic to-do list, allowing you to manage tasks with descriptions, categories, and due dates. It's perfect for organizing your work, personal life, and more. Here's what it can do:

📌 Task Categories: Categorize your tasks with labels like  Work, Personal, and more.

⏰ Due Dates: Set due dates for your tasks to stay organized and on top of deadlines.

🧹 Task Management: Easily add, remove, and display tasks with a user-friendly interface.

💾 Data Persistence: Your tasks are saved in a .txt file, so they're always there when you need them, even if you close the app.

This project was created using Python and is a great example of how programming can help streamline everyday tasks. Whether you're a developer looking to enhance your skills or just someone who loves staying organized, this Todo List app is a handy tool.
